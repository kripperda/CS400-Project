            <h2>Scenario 1 - Tracy</h2>
            <h4>Tracy is a soon to be grandmother. Her son and daughter-in-law have had 
            several baby showers to gather items they will need for their new baby. 
            The primary items they are lacking are toys for newborns. This includes 
            books and other stimulation toys for tummy time. <br>
            <br>
            After searching stores, the number of toys became overwhelming to pick.
            She sought advice from her friends and other grandparents to determine 
            what was actually needed. Her friends provided some great advice, but what 
            she really needed was real world experience for certain items. <br>
            <br>
            She was thinking of a collection of toys that she could try and pass down 
            to other grandmothers or even mothers in need. Specifically, she was most 
            worried about what would be most appropriate for a newborn as she anticipated 
            babysitting the baby quite often. <br>
            </h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Scenario 2 - Tracy</h2>
            <h4>Tracy is looking for new toys for her grandchild. As a grandparent, the baby 
            will not be at their home all the time so she does not want to break the bank 
            on buying toys. <br>
            <br>
            She has browsed websites and considered sites that donate toys rather than 
            buying directly. However she cannot find anything nearby that would satisfy 
            her need for limited toys for cheap or free.<br>
            <br>
            Location is important as she cannot drive very far due to an eye condition. 
            She would prefer something she could pick up in her neighborhood rather than 
            driving across town. <br>
            </h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Scenario 3 - Tracy</h2>
            <h4>Tracy's children are grown and out of the house. For the past several years 
            she has considered removing their old items that they used when they were 
            younger, but she is not sure what to do with them. There is a lot of things 
            in her basement that are taking up space. <br>
            <br>
            She thinks about trying to sell, but that would be time consuming and burdensome 
            for very little return. She would prefer to donate what she can in addition 
            to throwing some items out that are no longer fit for use. Many of the items are 
            still in good condition.<br>
            <br>
            Resources for donations are lacking in her area. She is seeking an aggregated 
            spot that shows what donation centers are in most need of what toys. She also 
            believes it to be importatnt that the donation organization can place the items 
            the hands of those in the most need. <br>
            <br>
            She believes the best approach would be for all places taking donations should 
            be listed in a single location and those places could, in turn, list the toys and 
            other items for free so that those less fortunate can receive what they need.
