            <h2>Scenario 1 - Jack</h2>
            <h4>Jack is an early career kindergarten teacher. He has a need to gather toys and 
            learning activities for his classroom. He has sought donations from students' 
            parents, but being in a low income school district has not afforded much 
            assistance from the parents. 

            He has also searched for items at yard sales and other stores like Goodwill, but 
            it is clear that good products are hard to find. He has looked online at other 
            websites and social media to try to come up with ideas for learning toys, but 
            the area he lives in does not have the resources to donate many items.

            Jack is willing to travel to find good products to build up the items in his 
            classroom, but he would prefer not to have to travel very far to collect them. 
            He also would like the items to be free or cheap.

            <h2>Scenario 2 - Jack</h2>
            <h4>Jack has a fun idea for an experiment for his kindergarten class, but the 
            experiment requires some items that are not easy to source. Living in an area 
            without many stores other than websites, it has become difficult to get supplies 
            in a short amount of time. 

            He would like to perform the experiment in conjunction with a weather event coming 
            up. The websites can ship items, but deliveries are unreliable and often late. By 
            the time the items arrive, the weather event will have passed and the point would 
            be missed by the students.

            He seeks donations from students' parents, but does not receive all of the items 
            necessary. He is forced to replan the experiment after the weather event due to 
            needing more ingredients to make it work properly. 
            </h4>

            <h2>Scenario 3 - Jack</h2>
            <h4>Jack recently found a seller on Facebook Marketplace selling a large amount of 
            toys nearby for a very good price that would be perfect for his students. He 
            negotiates with the seller and sets a plan to pick up the toys.

            Once he receives the toy he goes through them and realizes many of them are not 
            in the condition that the seller indicated. Most of the toys required batteries 
            that were dead and needing to be replaced. This would add a significant expense 
            on top of what he already paid for the toys. 

            Jack decides to cut his losses and uses the best toys he can find and fixes what 
            he can as well. He purchases some batteries but exchanges them out with other toys 
            needing batteries to rotate the toys out often. The children do not notice, but 
            Jack knows that he was essentially conned on what he thought he was getting. 
            Luckily his creativity made the best of the situation.
