                <h2>Scenario 1 - Shannon</h2>
                <h4>Shannon is looking for toys for Christmas in an initiative called "Thriftmas" 
                which is where gently used toys are bought second hand rather than spending
                a lot of money on new toys for Christmas presents. She would rather save for 
                things her children need such as books and clothes rather than toys they
                will play with for a few months then forget about.<br>
                <br>
                Shannon begins asking on social media platforms for gently used toys as well 
                as searching sites like Marketplace and Mercari for cheap or free toys. She has 
                discovered that everything requires batteries. Most of the toys found are 
                in good shape, but the batteries have died and the children stoped playing with 
                it. <br>
                <br>
                After inquiring about the toys, people stopped responding as regularly. Her 
                regular question about battery level appears to be the stopper in her inquiries.
                Shannon wishes there was a program or site that would require sellers or offerors 
                to make sure the batteries are in working order or offer new batteries rather 
                than just stop responding.<br>

                <h2>Scenario 2 - Shannon</h2>
                <h4>Shannon has an 8 year old that is getting into more science-based activities.
                She has inquired with the library and rented out books for activities that 
                require more ingredients and items than typical household items. These would be 
                beneficial for Girl Scouts activities as well.<br>
                <br>
                She seeks input from her network of friends and gathers quite a few of the items 
                needed but with several more to go. <br>
                <br>
                She has found there is a science store about 30 miles away that has many of 
                these items to do multiple activities for cheap. However, this store is well 
                out of the way. There are no times when she will head that way to get the 
                remaining items.<br>
                <br>
                Outside of her friend network she wishes there were a site for hand-me-down 
                activities and items for these science experiments that sources the items based 
                on location near to her. She could stop off on her way to work or the store to 
                pick up on a porch, even for a small fee.<br>
                </h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Scenario 3 - Shannon</h2>
                <h4>With children of various ages, Shannon has been able to pass down toys and her 
                younger children have become very good at playing with toys and puzzles beyond
                their current age. However, she is finding that there is a shortage among friends 
                and family for puzzles of various difficulty.<br>
                <br>
                Any puzzles handed down tend to be old and missing pieces. Or the pieces are bent 
                and do not connect properly. This makes it difficult for her kids to solve and 
                they get frustrated. <br>
                <br>
                She goes to the store and looks online for new puzzles, but they are not a cheap 
                activity. Any puzzles listed on Marketplace simply show the box and are listed for 
                near retail prices. <br>
                <br>
                She wishes the seller or any offering for free would require a picture of the 
                complete puzzle in the listing to allevaite frustration for her children and 
                also herself when they get frustrated.<br>
