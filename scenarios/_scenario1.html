                <h2>Scenario 1 - Bronwyn</h2>
                <h4>Bronwyn has been asked by the PTO to gather donated toys for a toy drive.
                The toy drive is aimed to focus on the children donating toys to other children 
                in another town that is a bit less fortunate. The PTO wants the children to 
                understand the good fortune we have in our community.<br>
                <br>
                She wants to be sure the toys are in good shape rather than just junk that people
                have cleaned out of their basement. <br>
                <br>
                Bronwyn starts scanning Facebook Marketplace for toys listed as free and
                realizes that the majority of the "free" toys are old, dirty, and not a 
                good fit for the toy drive. 
                As the toys sought are for the same ages as children in the school, it 
                has been tough to narrow down the age ranges.<br>
                <br>
                Bronwyn seeks advice from others on the PTO. One parent mentions Play It Forward 
                as a new program that aggregates many toys looking to be donated and is sorted by 
                age groups.
                Bronwyn finds several toys on the site that people are looking to get rid of 
                to use for the toy drive.<br>

                <h2>Scenario 2 - Bronwyn</h2>
                <h4>Bronwyn is looking to develop her summer learning plan for her children when
                school releases for summer. She has utilized the library in the past for activities 
                and shared them with her neighbors. Many of these are called "take and makes" 
                which involves various crafts that keep kids engaged and using their minds.<br>
                <br>
                The library has discontinued the "take and make" program. She utilizes some other 
                sites such as Pinterest to get ideas, but the cost of materials to put the pieces 
                together would cost a fortune. She gathers what she has for some ideas but soon 
                finds out she is missing pieces necessary with no good alternatives.<br>
                <br>
                Some of these pieces are not toys but there are some crafts that require little 
                toys as part of the actviity. She would utilize the activity many times throughout 
                the summer and repeat them so a larger quantity would not be a bad thing.<br>
                <br>
                Rather than purchasing the pieces needed, she sought other mom groups she knows 
                to see if they had these items. With various sources providing the pieces, it 
                would have been much easier if everything were in one site to seek and pick up.<br>

                She seeks help from other mom groups via Facebook. However, they are scattered 
                all across the county and would cost a great deal in gas and time trying to 
                source all of the pieces offered.<br>
                <br>
                She wishes there were a system with aggregated, location-based searching for the 
                craft items she is looking for rather than driving across God's green earth.
