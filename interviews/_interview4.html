Confused on where to find toys for his classroom without being a Facebook user or receiving a newspaper to know about yard sales
Want to know the amount of usage of each item (lightely used, etc.)
Multiple angles of each item with pictures
Ability to verify as a teacher to let people know he's a reliable person to donate to
Ability to seperate between education and play toys
       (specifically puzzles for stations; toys for indoor recess)
Can teachers ask for other classroom material donations?
        (pencils, crayons, coloring books, children's books, etc.)
Ability to create a wish list of items I'm looking for if I can't find that item currently
        (like an Amazon wishlist)
        (Get notified when that item is posted within a 50 mile radius of me - specifically wants a play kitchen for students)
