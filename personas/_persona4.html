        <h2>Jack, first year teacher</h2>
        Jack, age 22, is a first year kindergarten teacher at a Title-I school in Kentucky.<br>
        He was born and raised in Fort Thomas, Kentucky. He received his Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education from Northern Kentucky University and 
        student taught in the Fort Thomas Independent School District.<br>
        Jack's parents were both teachers in the Fort Thomas Independent School System.<br>
        Fort Thomas's school system provided endless support and resources for their teachers and students.<br>
        <br>
        Jack moved to Trimble County, Kentucky with his fiance, which is a low income area. <br>
        He was surprised to learn about the limited resources for the school district. In addition, many parents did not have the funds to donate to the classroom.<br>
        Jack was needing toys for his classroom for playtime and indoor recess in the winter. Currently, students are just drawing on paper and watching brain breaks on YouTube.<br>
        He wants to provide toys in his classroom to promote creativity and motor skill development for his students.<br>
        He has not been able to find many toys at local yardsales and Jack does not use FaceBook.<br>
        He wants a way to ask for donations from people in Trimble County or near his hometown of Fort Thomas with drop off at his parent's home.<br>
