Jack's parents were both teachers in the Fort Thomas Indepentent School System.
Fort Thomas's school system provided endless support and resources for their teachers and students.

He was surprised to learn about the limited resources for the school district. In addition, many parents did not have the funds to donate to the classroom.
Jack was needing toys for his classroom for playtime and indoor recess in the winter. Currently, students are just drawing on paper and watching brain breaks on YouTube.
He wants to provide toys in his classroom to promote creativity and motor skill development for his students.
He has not been able to find many toys at local yardsales and Jack does not use FaceBook.ÃŸ
He wants a way to ask for donations from people in Trimble County or near his hometown of Fort Thomas with drop off at his parent's home.
