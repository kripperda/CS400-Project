Tracy, Future Grandma, Pediatric nurse
Tracy, age undisclosed, is a pediatric nurse in Missouri. She has been a nurse for nearly 40 years in various roles.
She has two grown children, one lives near and one lives in California. 
Her first grandchild is on the way. She has been gathering toys and things needed for a first time grandmother.
The other grandparents of the baby live next door so they are interested in using shared items as necessary.

Tracy typically does not use buying and selling websites, especially for toys, as she has not needed to.
However, with a grandchild expected, she wants to be sure she has appropriate toys to make it easier on the parents
to drop off the baby and not have to bring the whole house with them. 
This will include toys as well as changes of outfits and other necessary items to take care of the baby.
