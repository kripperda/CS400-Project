        <h2>Tracy, Future Grandma, Pediatric nurse</h2>
        Tracy, age undisclosed, is a pediatric nurse in Missouri. She has been a nurse for nearly 40 years in various roles.<br>
        She has two grown children, one lives near and one lives in California. <br>
        Her first grandchild is on the way. She has been gathering toys and things needed for a first time grandmother.<br>
        The other grandparents of the baby live next door so they are interested in using shared items as necessary.<br>
        <br>
        Tracy typically does not use buying and selling websites, especially for toys, as she has not needed to.<br>
        However, with a grandchild expected, she wants to be sure she has appropriate toys to make it easier on the parents.<br>
        to drop off the baby and not have to bring the whole house with them. <br>
        This will include toys as well as changes of outfits and other necessary items to take care of the baby.<br>
