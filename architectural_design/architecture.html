                    <p class = "description">
                        The simplest set up for our application is a three-tier architecture.<br>
                        In the client layer, the front-end is the web browser or mobile application used by the end user. <br>
                        The middle layer will house the server which communicates between the application and the database and perform the data pull 
                        return to the end user.<br>
                        The third layer is the data tier that stores and manages the data such as a NoSQL database. This tier will 
                        host the pictures, descriptions, and information of the users looking to donate or receive donations.<br>
                        This architecture is especially beneficial for a large number of users for specific locations.<br>

                        <h4>Scalability Challenges - Anticipated upgrades in subsequent versions</h4>
                        <h4>Higher Costs - Additional costs for development, deployment, and maintenance for added layer</h4>
                        <h4>Complex Maintenance and Upgrades - Time consuming upgrades to increase scalability with adjustments across multiple layers</h4>                
                        <h4>Increase Latency - Additional processing steps in handling requests can lead to slower response times</h4>                       
                        <h3>Separation of Concerns</h3>
                        Remove currency and transaction aspect and focus solely on donations<br>
                        Locations limited to 50 miles of user locations<br>
                        Reuse framework for each and every listings (minimum 2 photos)<br>

                        <h3>Cross-Cutting Concerns</h3>
                        Record every action a verified user performs<br>
                        Check user permissions before accessing resources<br>
                        Handle errors that may occur<br>
                        Monitor performance of servers and databases<br>
